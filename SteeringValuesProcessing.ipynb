I don't want my vehicle to wildly swing to one side of the road when it's driving nice and smoothly down the center. However, I do need data that tells the vehicle what to do when it does find itself near the edge of the road and wants to steer back toward center.

For the steering values, I generated small random values between -0.1 and 0.1. This training data represents the behavior I want the vehicle to have when it's in the center and looking directly down the road, thus the small steering values. I then oriented the vehicle almost perpendicular to the lane markings, and began collecting 80 frames as I gradually steered back to the center of the road. I then generated 80 evenly spaced values between -1 and 0 for the steering values. This represents the behavior I want the vehicle to perform when it finds itself near the center of the road, but not looking directly down the road. I then repeated the same thing for the left side of the road, but used steering values arranged evenly from 1 to 0. I then needed data for when the vehicle found itself on either side of the road, looking directly down the road. I captured frames of the vehicle placed near the edge of the road and steering gradually back to center, and gave them a steering value arranged evenly from 0.5 to 0 for the left side, and -0.5 to 0 for the right."
